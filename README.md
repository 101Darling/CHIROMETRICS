# CHIROMETRICS - Chiropractic PI Patient Reports
Welcome to CHIROMETRICS, the simple software for effective Chiropractic PI Reports! ---v.01
Since most chiropractors utilize spreadsheets and similar platforms to keep track of patient data and journeys, I decided to create a simple program that explores these spreadsheets, analyzes the data and brings forth a visual report along with relevant PI..
...metrics for the clinic.

Prog Description(CHIROMETRICS version 0.01):
    It is difficult to make accurate decisions without having a basic understanding of Clinic
    numbers. This program helps you to know where the PI practice is struggling,
    and where you need to focus your attention. I implore you to know your Personal Injury Clinic KPIs.

PROLOG:
    Reference parameters needed:
    pt visit dates, medpay, attorney info

    What questions can bring greater insights?
    Exploration:
    What is the monthly average for New PI patients?
    Who is the top referral firm, avg referrals, and how many thus far?
    What percentage of the clinics pi pt’s have med pay?

    Visualization:
    Visualize attorney relationships, what are the number of referrals monthly
    Visualize the annual patient visits month-to-month
    Visualize pt with med pay vs pt without medpay, month-to-month and annual
